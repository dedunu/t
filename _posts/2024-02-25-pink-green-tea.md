## Original Description

A unique green tea, light pink in color! It starts with the leaf, these are purple by a unique variety of the Camellia Sinensis. Japanese techniques are applied to the leaf, which ultimately gives the tea the pink color. If you want to enhance the pink color, put a drop of lemon in the tea and see the tea turn pink, see photo (right is lemon).

The taste is difficult to describe, the tea has a very own character and is not really compared. The tea is dried in an oven after the tea is rolled and repeated a number of times.

Sri Lanka is known for pure or blended black tea. Since 2020, CATA has been founded, the ‘Ceylon Artisanal Tea Association’ with the aim of making beautiful specialty tea. One of the participants is Forest Hill.
