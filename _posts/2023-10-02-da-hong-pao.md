## Original Description

‘The King of Teas’ is how Da Hong Pao is known in China, and that title does not come easily. Growing in the likely birthplace of black and oolong teas, the Wuyi mountains of Fujian, China, the original Da Hong Pao was the most respected of all Chinese teas since the Ming dynasty – legend has it that the mother of an emperor was cured after drinking tea made from certain bushes growing high up on a rock. He ordered that these bushes be cloaked with imperial red robes (Da Hong Pao means Great Red Robe). Six of those original bushes still survive, and a very small portion of tea is still made from them each year, fetching hundreds of thousands of euro for a few hundred grams. This was the tea Chairman Mao presented to Nixon on his historic visit to the USA.

This DHP is one of the simple blends from the Wuyi region and an easy and affordable everyday oolong which carries on the taste tradition and legend of Da Hong Pao...
