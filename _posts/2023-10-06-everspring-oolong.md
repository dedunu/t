## Original Description

If you found yourself visiting the beautiful island of Taiwan and taking a hike into the mountains, the intoxicating floral scent of light oolong would accompany you everywhere. The name of this tea bush variety is Si Ji Chun, which literally means "four spring seasons", and the name of our tea is derived from it, Everspring. This bush variety is known and appreciated among farmers for its lush growth, which is why it can be harvested several times a year. We are delighted to be able to offer this beautiful and classic yet more affordable Taiwanese oolong in our range. The tea is harvested and brewed in Mingjian, Taiwan.
