## Original Description

«Gaba Shu Cha» is an experimental Shu puer manufactured in Dali County (altitude is more than 2500 meters) by the special order of the company Moychay with the participation of experts from Kunming University from the raw material of the spring harvest of 2020.

In appearance: medium-sized brown and reddish flagella of twisted tips. The aroma is restrained, with a biscuit and creamy hints. The infusion is slightly muddy, yellowish-chestnut.

The bouquet of the ready-made tea is mature, nutty-and-woody, with creamy, biscuit and mushroom notes. The aroma is calm and viscous, nutty with a mushroom accent. The taste is rich and smooth, sweetish, with juicy bitterness of cocoa beans and the mild finish.

Brew tea with hot water (95°C) in a gaiwan or a teapot made of porous clay. The proportion is 6-7 g per 100 ml. The time of the first steeping is about 5-7 seconds. After that do short steeps (just for 1 second) increasing steeping time for each subsequent step, if necessary. You can steep the tea up to 10 times.

«Gaba Shu Cha» is a great choice for a variety of situations and moods: to wake up and harmoniously join the flow of the new day in the morning and to tune in to the evening rest.
