## Original Description

This green tea comes from bushes living 1200 meters high in the Wen mountain in Yunnan and offers just what you'd expect from a cup of daily Chinese green tea: tenderness and refreshment. Perhaps its name comes from the snowy mountain peaks near its home - it would be a romantic nod to an elegance this tea imparts. The leaves are picked from March to July, as are the lovely light-coloured buds which pepper this tea. A perfect balance of yin-yang, delicacy and brawniness. See if you can detect a soft note of apricot in its aftertaste.  

### Origin

Yunnan, China
