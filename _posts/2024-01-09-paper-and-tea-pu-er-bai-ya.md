## Original Product Description

While the plump, pale-green buds of ancient wild tea trees are real eye catchers, it is their inner beauty that we fell for: A woody-resinous character surprises with flowery sweetness, hints of hay and spice, and a good dose of caffeine to liven the spirits and open the mind.

At first glance, a white pu-erh tea might seem like quite the contradiction in terms to any aficionado of Chinese tea. After all, the terms each refer to the opposite end of the spectrum of tea processing. Cultivated in the Chinese province of Yunnan, a good 1500 meters above sea level, it is a particular strain of twig buds from ancient wild tea trees traditionally used in pu-erh production that lend themselves so unexpectedly well to gentle white tea processing. The plump, fresh buds are harvested in early spring and carefully sun-dried. In return they impart an utterly unique – yet pleasantly subtle – aroma delicately sweetened by their sheer wealth of health-inducing amino acids.
