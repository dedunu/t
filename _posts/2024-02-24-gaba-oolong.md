## Original Description

A medium roasted oolong tea. GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) is a substance that is produced in your brain in your brain and has the function of reducing anxiety and nervousness. There is a lot of information about it, even though it is not scientifically determined whether the GABA in tea (or supplements) can pass through the blood/brain barrier.

Apart from that, it is a nice tea with a grid edge. If the grid content seems different, this is good feedback from the maker:

The roasting can be the same every time. We always use the same temperature and the same times. But some tea leaves react slightly to the fire. Sometimes if it’s the new freshly baked tea you smells may the fire aroma a bit stronger.

GABA in tea was discovered in the 1980s by a Japanese researcher from the Japanese National Research Institute of Tea. He discovered when looking at how to make food tenable that if you expose tea to nitrogen during the oxidation process, the content of GABA will increase.

According to the Japanese government, the level of GABA must be at least 150mg/100gr of tea. This GABA contains over 200mg/100gr tea.

How is it made:

- About 2 weeks before picking, the plants are shaded, which produces glutamic acid.
- The blade is picked and goes into a sealed vessel that is pulled vacuum to remove the oxygen.
- In this vessel, nitrogen is then done for about 6 to 10 hours. The glutamic acid now changes to GABA (Gamma-AminoButyric Acid).
- After this, the leaf is heated in the wok to stop oxidizing.
- After this, the oolong is processed as normal, rolling, drying, compressing.
- At last, the tea is baked to dry further
