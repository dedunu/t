## Original Description

### Ebony Springs “Green Tea Cigars”

Ebony Springs “Green Tea Cigars” are one of the unique products of Ebony Springs tea garden in Sri Lanka. The “green tea cigars” are made exclusively from the delicate second leaves of each “1+2” shoot of the TRI2043 tea plant cultivated there. After drying to about 45% moisture content, the leaves undergo steaming at 100°C to stop the enzymatic oxidation process. Each leaf is then individually and manually rolled into a tubular shape, with the underside facing outward and taking on a bronze sheen created by the silvery fuzz on the underside of the TRI2043 leaves.

The playful and visually appealing shape of the hand-rolled tea leaf makes curious about what the tea might offer in terms of taste. The resulting infusion, however, does not even hint at the tea’s origin in a country rather known for mass-produced teas. Instead, the bright green cup reminds us of the finest green teas of China, with fresh vegetal spring green and a hint of lemon coating the palate.

### Preparation of Ebony Springs Green Tea Cigars

To prepare Ebony Springs Green Tea Cigars, first steep 2-3g of tea per 100ml in a suitable vessel with 90°C hot water. Depending on personal taste preference, let steep for 1-2 minutes. After this, a second infusion doesn’t fall behind the first.

### Ebony Springs – The Tea Garden

Ebony Springs Tea Garden is located in the lower region of Nuwara Eliya, near Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, and Adams Peak. About 102 kilometers from Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, this tea garden stands out for its particularly artisanal tea-making process. It is part of the growing movement of handmade teas in Sri Lanka led by the Ceylon Artisanal Tea Association (CATA).

The founder of Ebony Springs, Bernard Holsinger, is considered one of the pioneers of handmade teas. After working on leading large estates in the western high-grown district until 2003, he dreamed of establishing a small tea garden with its own processing unit that would provide tea lovers from around the world with homemade tea experiences. Finally, Holsinger bought 2 hectares of weed-overgrown land available at an affordable price in southern Nuwara Eliya. After removing the weeds, he planted it with the TRI2043 cultivar, famous for its purple leaves with shiny, large, and hairy buds, which are often used to make white “Silver Tips”.
