## Original Product Description

“Gaba Assam Hong Cha” is a red tea processed with anaerobic fermentation technology from Doi Mai Salong Village, Changrai District (altitude 1000m). Assamica shoots were used as raw materials.

In appearance: red-brown, twisted tea shoots with thin cuttings. The aroma is intensive, fruity with a biscuit hint. The infusion is transparent, with a reddish-chestnut shade.

The bouquet of ready-made tea is bright, fruity with floral, spicy, woody, biscuit and berry notes. The aroma is intense, warm, fruity-floral. The taste is full-bodied and juicy, a bit tart, spicy, sweetish, with berry sourness and refreshing finish.

Steep the tea in a hot water (95°C) in a gaiwan or a teapot made of porous clay. The proportion is 5-6 g per 100 ml. The time of the first steeping is 10 seconds. Then do short steeps (2-3 seconds) increasing steeping time for each subsequent step, if necessary. You can steep the tea up to 9 times.

"Gaba Assam Hong Cha" is a great choice for an emotional reboot – rich, vivid and very fragrant.
