## Original Description

Yin Zhen, one of the classics amongst white teas is a tea that truly aims for perfection. If you could drink silk, this is what it would taste like. White teas have been produced in China since the Song dynasty (960-1279) and it was offered as a tribute to the Imperial court. The finest white teas, such as Bai Hao Yin Zhen, is made using only the buds of the tea plant. For one kilo of tea, one would need to pick 20 000 buds by hand - quite the task! - as machines would injure the delicate buds. This sort of tea tastes fresh as the early morning dew, it is delicate with a lingering sweetness.

### Origin
