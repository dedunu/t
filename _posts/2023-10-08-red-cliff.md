## Original Description

This is a beautiful gongfu red tea from Tongmu village in Wuyi mountain range. It is from the same farm and made from the same Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong (True Mountain Small Leaf) tea varietal plants as our high grade smoked Lapsang, but it is processed differently and left unsmoked. The tea is light, refined, highly aromatic and ethereal, leaving you asking for more.
