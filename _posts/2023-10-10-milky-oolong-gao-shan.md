## Original Description

For lovers of flavoured oolong teas, this high quality option from Mingjian, Taiwan is an unforgettable experience. It is quite a few steps above the basic grade milky oolongs. The proof is in the subtly nuanced flavour profile and the fact that you can easily steep this 5-8 times, enjoying high-grade tea in each steeping. Picked by hand from original Jin Xuan varietal bushes, and produced according to Taiwanese organic regulations.
