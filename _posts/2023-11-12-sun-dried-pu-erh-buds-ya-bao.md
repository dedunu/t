## Original Product Description

These buds differ greatly from Silver Tips because they come from a different varietal of camellia tea tree that grows in Western Yunnan. The buds are picked in early spring and sun-dried. After brewing this tea one can play with buds, picking them apart gently…  Marvel at the fractal layers of unopened buds that are contained in a single bud. We’ve counted 9!

Harvest: Spring, 2023

Color of liquor: very light and clear
