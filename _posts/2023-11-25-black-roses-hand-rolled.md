## Original Product Description

ST. CLAIRâ€™S Black Roses is hand rolled tea is a wonderful creation through the finger tips of dedicated female workers of a world renowned tea factory in the Sabaragamuwa Region of Sri Lanka coming from the small holder grower families in the surrounding area.

Long, tender, naturally withered, individual tea leaves are meticulously hand rolled and tightened to form a shape of rose and then passes through the drying process. Due to its nature of meticulous process, delicate handling and very limited quantity, the product is highly priced.

When poured with hot water, the tightened roses are slowly uncurled and whole tea leaves are brewed to pale yellow colour, delicate and soothing liquor with a honey caramel hint.
