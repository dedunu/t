## Original Description

A unique white tea. At first I thought I had found a bargain because I thought it was very tasty and super soft, while the tea does not look like it was made with the best material. The tea turned out to be very pricey and when I heard how the tea is made I understood. After picking a Silver Needle, the top of the tea plant, the bottom part of the twig is removed. In proportion, 200kg of Silver Needle yields 1kg of these twig pieces.

So the tea is actually a byproduct of making Silver Needle. The available quantity is low, the owner of the plantation said that some only goes to the tea shop 'East India Company' in London.

Sri Lanka is known for black tea pure or in a blend. CATA, the 'Ceylon Artisanal Tea Association', has been founded in 2020 with the aim of making beautiful specialty tea. One of the participants is Ebony Springs.

Ebony Springs is a small plantation in western Sri Lanka at an altitude of approximately 60 meters. Ebony Springs specializes in white tea using the TRI2043 clone. Ebony Springs makes about 10 types of tea in small batches in their own micro factory.
