## Original Product Description

"Big Golden Tips" in Fengqing (Lincang County, North-west tea region of Yunnan Province).

Dry leaf: large, silky, reddish-yellow tips. The aroma is intensive, honey with floral touch. The infusion is transparent, light hazelnut color.

The brewed tea has bright, warm, multifaceted bouquet with notes of wood, dried fruits, honey, biscuits and spice. The fragrance is deep and warm, fruity. The taste is rich and soft, juicy, sweetish, with citrus acidity and delicate fruit tartness, transforming into sappy, lingering aftertaste.

Brew tea with hot water (95°С) in a gaiwan or in a teapot of porous clay. The proportion is 4-5 g per 100 ml. The time of the first steeping is about 6-8 seconds. After that do short steeps (just for 2-3 seconds), increasing steeping time for each subsequent step, if necessary. You can repeat this method up to 10 times.

"Big Golden Tips" is a great ceremonial tea: refined and deep, juicy and soft. It warms and relaxes the body, relieves psychological fatigue and gives rise to the sense of inner comfort.
