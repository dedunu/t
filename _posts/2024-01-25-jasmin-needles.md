## Original Description

A beautiful white Silver Needle from Yunnan, scented with jasmine. The organic version was already in the range, but I had this one for wholesale and it is very tasty. Very colorful, slightly cheaper than the organic version and still tested and EU-compliant. Can be served several times.
