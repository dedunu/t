## Original Description

This Golden Needles is a type of Dian Hong. Dian denotes that is comes from Yunnan and Hong means that it is hong cha, which literally translates as Red Tea, although most westerners would call it "Black Tea", a mistake that has been perpetuated for centuries. This particular tea comes from Feng Qing in Lincang. It is a lovely tea that has been lightly hand-rolled and hand-processed to preserve the beautiful shape of the leaves. You will find notes of cocoa, malt, caramel and wood with a very delicate smokiness. This tea handles many infusiones.
