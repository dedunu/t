## Original Product Description

Tea with the fragrant flavour of bergamot & lemon.

Our Classic Blend
In 1831 we created Earl Grey tea in our shop on the Strand on the request of the Prime Minister. He loved it so much he gave his name to it. Before long it had taken London by storm and it is still a firm favourite amongst people who like things with a twist, who travel off the beaten track and don't always play by the rules.

What does it taste like?
Our classic Earl Grey. A delicate tea with a delicious twist of citrusy bergamot.

What makes this tea different?
We carefully select a tea that is light, delicate and refreshing. It blends perfectly with the unique citrusy bergamot.

Blended and packed in Hampshire.
