The bushes that this tea is made of are about 200-300 years old. They grow in an area where further maintenance is not carried out, no fertilizer is used and no pesticides are used. The bushes grow slowly and the deep roots and the environment provide a very nice taste, as the Dian Hong should be traditionally.
