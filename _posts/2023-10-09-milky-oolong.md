## Original Description

Rolled tightly, similar to Tieguanyin and other quality oolongs, this aromatic delight is often people’s first foray into the world of oolong… and what a journey it is. Boasting a strong, sweet but buttery smell and taste, it gives you the feeling of indulging in a creamy pastry, but not suffering from the calories! Several floral hints are also detectable, most notably orchid, as well as a note of vanilla. Still, the classic oolong taste perseveres as this tea’s heart and soul and is strongly present. It impresses immediately, and for some people remains an all-time favourite, especially when drunk as an occasional treat. Produced from Tieguanyin varietal tea bushes in Xian You, 1100 meters above sea level. EU organic.
