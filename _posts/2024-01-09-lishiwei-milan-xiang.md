## Original Product Description

Lishiwei Milan Xiang (Honey Orchid) is the type of Guangdong Oolong tea, delightful and highly regarded variety of Chinese oolong tea. It originates from the province of Guangdong, located in southern China, where it is cultivated with great care and expertise.

The leaves of Guangdong Oolong are carefully handpicked from the tea bushes, ensuring that only the finest and freshest leaves are selected. These leaves are then meticulously processed using traditional techniques that have been perfected over centuries, resulting in a tea that showcases the skill and craftsmanship of the tea artisans.

When brewed, Guangdong Oolong exudes a captivating aroma that is both floral and fruity, with a distinct milky sweetness. The tea liquor possesses a beautiful amber hue, enticing tea enthusiasts with its vibrant and inviting appearance.

One of the remarkable characteristics of Guangdong Oolong is its smooth and velvety texture. The tea leaves are carefully rolled and oxidized, creating a medium-bodied infusion that coats the palate with a comforting and lingering mouthfeel. This tea strikes a perfect balance between the freshness of green tea and the complexity of black tea, making it a versatile choice for tea lovers who appreciate nuanced flavors.

The flavor profile of Guangdong Oolong is complex and multifaceted. It offers a harmonious blend of floral notes, reminiscent of orchids and magnolias, along with hints of ripened fruit, such as peaches and plums. The inherent sweetness is accompanied by a subtle creaminess, contributing to a well-rounded and satisfying taste experience.

Guangdong Oolong can be enjoyed through multiple infusions, with each steeping revealing new layers of flavor and aroma. The tea leaves unfurl gracefully, allowing the drinker to appreciate the full spectrum of the tea's characteristics.

Whether you are a seasoned tea connoisseur or a curious explorer of tea varieties, Guangdong Oolong, specifically Lishiwei Milan Xiang, offers a captivating and rewarding tea-drinking experience.
