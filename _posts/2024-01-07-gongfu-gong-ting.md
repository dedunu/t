## Original Description

Shu Pu-erh "Gongfu Gongting" ("Royal Superior") from Menghai County.

In appearance: small, flagellum twisted reddish-brown tips. The aroma is intensive, nutty. The infusion is dark chestnut-red.

The bouquet of the ready-made tea is mature, nutty-and-woody, with notes of bread, oak moss, date and autumn leaves. The aroma is warm and viscous, nutty. The taste is full-bodied and mellow, sweetish, with a soft woody astringency, sourness of dried berries and velvety finish.

Steep the tea in a hot water (95Â°C) in a gaiwan or a teapot made of porous clay. The proportion is 6-7 g per 100 ml. The time of the first steeping is about 10 seconds. After that do short steeps (just for 2-3 seconds) increasing steeping time for each subsequent step, if necessary. You can steep the tea up to 8 times.

Shu Puer "Gongfu Gongting" will charge you with vigour in the morning, maintain strength during the day, and in the evening it will help to exhale all unnecessary and relax.
