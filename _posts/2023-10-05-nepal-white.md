## Original Description

Filigree buds and top leaves are harvested in early months of March and April, high in Dankhuta, Nepal at an altitude around 2000 meters above sea level. The tea is made by a family business opened by two brothers twenty years ago, they call their tea garden Jun Chiyabari which translates to moonlit tea garden. They are active in the local community as well - aside employing over 200 people, they are helping local schools in the area with studying supplies, are restoring a school house as well as donate a part of the tea funds to teachers salary. The cup is delicate, light and refreshing, invorigating and fruity as high mountain white tea should be. EU organic, controlled by EE-ÖKO-03.
