## Original Description

«Big, White, Fluffy» sheng pu-erh is made of tea shoots of the Da Bai Hao variety (Big White Fluffy), collected in the Jinggu mountains in 2019.

In appearance: long brown flagella, slightly twisted. The aroma is intensive, fruity-balsamic. The infusion is transparent, with peach shade.

The bouquet of brewed tea is fruity-balsamic, with notes of dried apples, wood resins, spicy herbs, honey and citrus. The aroma is sweet and deep, of stewed fruit tonality. The taste is juicy and bright, sweet, with citrus sourness, minty coolness, nuances of spices and lingering finish.

Brew tea with hot water (85- 90°C) in a gaiwan or a teapot made of porous clay. The proportion is 5 g per 100 ml. The time of the first steeping is about 8-10 seconds. After that do short steeps (just for 1-2 seconds), increasing steeping time for each subsequent step, if necessary. You can steep the tea up to 9-10 times.

«Big, White, Fluffy» sheng pu-erh is an excellent choice for everyday tea drinking – easy brewing, unobtrusive and positive. Especially recommended to "fruit" sheng pu-erh lovers.
