## Original Product Description

"Chinese Red" was made made by master-technologist, nicknamed Da Shi (Mentor) in a small farm of Linzang County.

In appearance: long needles of dark brown tea leaves. The fragrance is deep, fruity with spicy and biscuit hints. The liquor is transparent, with meadow honey shade.

The bouquet of ready-made tea is vivid and warm, multifaceted, fruity, with spicy, honey, apricot kernel and biscuit notes. The fragrance is deep and warm, calming. The taste is rich and full-bodied, silky, a bit tart, sweetish, with citrus sourness and lingering finish.

Brew tea with hot water (95°С) in a gaiwan or in a teapot of porous clay. The proportion is 4 g per 100 ml. The time of the first steeping is about 6-8 seconds. After that do short steeps (just for 2-3 seconds), increasing steeping time for each subsequent step, if necessary. You can repeat this method up to 9 times.

"Chinese Red" is a great choice for both everyday and ceremonial tea drinking. Multifaceted and bright, quite soft and delicate, it is perfect for emotional reboot in the second half of the day, and for evening rest in low concentration.
