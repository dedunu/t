## Original Product Description

ST. CLAIRâ€™S Ceylon Silver Tips is a rare white tea, made from specially selected and carefully handpicked finest silver haired buds of a special variety of tea bush. It is very rare because of extremely limited production quantity and the meticulous process of sun drying of delicate, long sliver haired buds shielding from direct sunlight, just to evaporate natural moisture.

This elegant Ceylon Silver Tips brews to pale yellow straw-coloured liquor with light, sweet, smooth, sublime flavour and a hint of floral bouquet on the palate.
