## Original Description

Golden Needles or Golden Buds are definitely among the top layer of red tea - only hand-picked buds of the tea plant make it a truly exclusive tea. Thousands of buds are picked and carefully sorted to make one kilo of tea, which is a hugely awe-inspiring job! Young tea leaves are covered with a light, light coat, which is characteristic of certain varieties of the tea bush in Yunnan, China. It also affects the texture and taste of the tea in a perceptible and peculiar way, which is fascinating to observe while drinking. Sweet to the taste, rich and with a strong cocoa-like aroma, lively and catchy tea in the mood!
