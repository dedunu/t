## Original Description

A very rare hand-rolled tea from Sri Lanka. Idulgashinna ‘Blink Bonnie’ Twists Ceylon Organic are carefully made in the Uva region of Sri Lanka, a high elevation area on the eastern side of the central highlands. The Idulgashinna tea garden was the first tea garden in the world to be certified Organic, and the first Sri Lankan producer to be recognised by Demeter for their Biodynamic Agricultural practices. The tea itself starts with meticulous plucking of just 2 leaves and a bud. The production then follows a traditional black tea methodology with withering, rolling and oxidation, but before the final drying stage the leaves are moistened again, and hand rolled into the distinctive twists. Use a good pinch of twists (2.5g) per cup and brew between 90°C and 100°C for 4 minutes. At lower temperatures the aroma will be more subtle and floral, with the sweet fruity notes more pronounced at higher temperatures, so it is worth having a play with the brewing parameters. These twists can be brewed twice. You will notice many similarities to the 'Blue Nettle' Rods, but this tea is darker and more aromatic, with more pronounced fruit notes and a sweet caramel finish.
