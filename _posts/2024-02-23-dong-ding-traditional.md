The origin of this Dong Ding traditional (Hong Shui) is the same as the regular Dong Ding.

The Ching Xin cultivar is said to have originated in China’s Wuyi Mountains. A small number of plants were planted on the Dong Ding Mountains in Nantou County in the middle of Taiwan. This proved to be an excellent place to grow tea.

Nowadays Dong Ding is made in several places and the distinctiveness of Dong Ding is especially the slightly longer oxidation and especially roasting time and this Dong Ding traditional is still oxidized and roasted.
