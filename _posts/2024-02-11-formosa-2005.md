## Original Description

This tea from Taiwan is matured in earthenware pots. It is re-roasted over charcoal every few years to keep the moisture content down.

The charcoal is very prominent in the taste and smell of the first cup of brewed tea. In subsequent pours, the color of the tea remains clear and the taste becomes warm and sweet. With charcoal in the aftertaste, but it increasingly fades into the background. The taste lingers well. It is a tea that is tightly rolled and delivers a lot of flavor.

- a mixture of varieties

An oolong is 'matured' after about 3 years. After 6 to 8 years the tea is good and the taste will continue to develop after that.

The leaf used for this tea is 20-30% oxidized. The leaf is then roasted until it reaches a humidity level that allows the tea to continue oxidizing very slowly. Earthenware or stone pots are also used for this purpose to store tea. The tea is therefore not sealed airtight. After about 2 years, the tea is examined and it is determined whether the leaf is roasted again to keep the moisture content low and preserve the taste.
