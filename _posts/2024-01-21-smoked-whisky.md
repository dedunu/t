## Original Product Description

### History of tea:

This smoked tea is the first in Japan, a unique production. Creator Hiroki Matsumoto first called the tea fuji-san Souchong. Hiroko manages a small plantation with his father.

About 15 years ago, Hiroki began to partially take over management from his father and started looking for ways to expand the company. He also wanted to do something different than just mixing black tea with fruit or aromas, for example.

He then came up with the idea of ​​using Chinese Lapsang Souchong tea to smoke Japanese black tea. After a few years of trying, he got the idea to use used whisk barrels to smoke the tea. This gave the tea a unique character and a new tea was born.

### Plantation management

The tea is grown according to the 'Chagusaba' method. It is a system of traditional agricultural techniques with grassland around the plantation, the green waste of which is used to improve the soil of the plantation. It is a wonderful example of a collaboration between agricultural production and biodiversity that reinforce each other.

### Making process:

After harvesting the leaf, it is wilted for about 20 hours. The leaf is then dried and rolled for 2 hours and then completely oxidized in 2 hours. The leaf is then dried for an hour and then smoked for 6-8 hours with wood chips from old whiskey barrels from a famous whiskey in Japan, the award-winning Ichiro Distillery in Chichibu, Saitama.
