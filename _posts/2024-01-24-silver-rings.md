Ebony Springs Tea Gardens is a tea farm located in Nawalapitiya, Sri Lanka, known for producing high-quality single-estate teas. The farm is owned and operated by Bernard Holsinger, a veteran tea planter with over 50 years of experience in the industry. Ebony Springs has a rich history of producing some of the finest teas in the region, using traditional methods and techniques passed down for generations. The teas produced at Ebony Springs are unique because they are single-estate teas, meaning they are grown, harvested, and processed on the same farm. This results in teas with distinct characteristics and flavors that are not found in blended teas from multiple farms. The farm is located at an altitude of just below 600 meters.

Ebony Springs is located about 8 kilometers from Nawalapitiya. The district ranges in elevation from Nuwara Eliya, which is at an altitude of 1900 meters, to the lower areas of the region like Ebony Springs. Ebony Springs is one of the few farms in Sri Lanka that produces single-estate teas.
