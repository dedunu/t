## Original Description

Sencha loose tea is by far the most popular green tea in Japan. Sencha Fuji is a superior green tea grown on the tea slopes near Mount Fuji.

This high-quality green tea is picked in the spring and lightly steamed before rolling. With its pleasantly soft note and a slight sweetness, this sencha tea is particularly recommended.
